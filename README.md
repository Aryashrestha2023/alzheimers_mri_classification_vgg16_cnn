# üß† Alzheimer's Disease Classification Using Deep Learning on MRI Scans

A deep learning-based pipeline for classifying Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease stages from MRI brain scans using **Custom CNNs** and **VGG16-based Transfer Learning**. This project explores the efficacy of deep neural networks in diagnosing AD, focusing on preprocessing, model architecture, and performance comparison across two medical imaging datasets.

## üìñ Overview

Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition causing cognitive decline, for which early detection is crucial. In this study, we leverage **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning** (VGG16) to build robust models capable of detecting and classifying stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease using brain MRI images.

## üìö Datasets

### üß¨ 1. ADNI Dataset (Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)

- **Classes**: CN (Cognitively Normal), EMCI, LMCI, AD  
- **Images**: 39,929 total  
- **Image Format**: Preprocessed MRI scans  
- **Standardized Size**: 224√ó224 pixels

### üß† 2. Alzheimer's Disease Multiclass Dataset

- **Classes**: NonDemented, VeryMildDemented, MildDemented, ModerateDemented  
- **Images**: 44,000 total  
- **Image Format**: JPEG, skull-stripped and cleaned  
- **Standardized Size**: 224√ó224 pixels

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing & Image Enhancement

- **Resizing & Normalization**
- **Data Augmentation** (rotation, zoom, shift, flip)
- **Edge Detection**: Canny, Laplacian, Sobel
- **Segmentation**: Binary thresholding and K-Means clustering
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Histogram Equalization & CLAHE

These techniques enhanced the model's ability to detect structural anomalies such as fluid-filled regions and gray/white matter boundaries.
